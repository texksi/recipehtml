    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>135g/4Â¾oz plain flour
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder
        </li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter (allowed to cool slightly) or olive oil, plus extra for cooking
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl. In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then whisk in the melted butter.

        </li>
        <li>Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When it's melted, add a ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time). It will seem very thick but this is how it should be.
