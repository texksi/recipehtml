    <h1>Blueberry muffin</h1>
    <img src="../html-boilerplate/img/img1.jpg" alt="Muffin image">
    <p>Every single time I make blueberry muffins, I play a game. The "look at every blueberry muffin recipe on
        Allrecipes, and try to figure out which one to make" game. "This one!...oh wait, I don't have sour cream." "This
        one. Nevermind, I don't have buttermilk." You see where this is going.
    </p>
    <p>So, I've done the hard part. These are the 5 top-rated blueberry muffin recipes on Allrecipes. I've included a
        list of the recipe ingredients for each recipe to save you time. Scroll through the ingredients, determine what
        you have on hand, and let that help you decide what recipe you're going to make.
    </p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>


    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425째F (218째C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or line with cupcake liners.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high
            speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and beat on high until creamed, about 2
            full minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs, sour cream, and vanilla
            extract. Beat on medium speed for 1 minute, then turn up to high speed until the mixture is combined. Scrape
            down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the batter evenly into each cup or liner, filling each all the way to the top. Bake the muffins for 5
            minutes at 425 then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350째F (177째C). Bake for
            an additional 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time
            these muffins take in the oven is about 22-23 minutes, give or take. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes
            in the muffin pan, then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling.
